# BOOKS RATING PREDICTION 

This project was carried out as part of my studies in data analysis. 
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict books rating. 
A data analysis has been conducted, and several types of models have been proposed.

I used the initial dataset as a basis. I then decided to add a column to it ("Genre"). To achieve this, I had to transform multiple datasets and convert them to .csv format, before merging them with the initial dataset.

## Installation : Necessary Modules 

Open your Anaconda & prompt : type and run the following command (individually):

```bash
 -   pip install pandas
 -   pip install numpy  
 -   pip install seaborn
 -   pip install matplotlib
 -   pip install scikit-learn
 -   pip install imbalanced-learn
 -   pip install --upgrade pip
```
Once Installed, we can import them inside our python code.
